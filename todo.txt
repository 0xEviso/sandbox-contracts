ETHGateway:
[x] Base contract/test files
[x] deposit
[x] redeem
[ ] mint? (because erc4626 uses mint/deposit withdraw/redeem with slightly different logic, should we match that here?)
[ ] withdraw (same as above)
[ ] Make it work with whitelisting

Vault:
[x] Base contract/test files
[x] Whitelist on deposit
[ ] add/register strategy
[ ] change strategy allocation
[ ] calculate strategy allocation
[ ] move funds from idle to allocated strategies
[ ] revoke strategy (no new funds sent)
[ ] divest from strategies
[ ] Accounting?
[ ] Pause/Unpause capital
[ ] Prevent Deposit + withdrawal within the same block
[ ] 1% exit fee

Strategy:
[ ] Base contract/test files
[ ] plug into cowswap?
[ ] invest/divest to vault
[ ] should have a function to estimate the value of the strategy assets in the vault's asset (i.e. I have 8 reth worth 10.4584758 WETH Sir.) oracle needed?
[ ] There is also a whole accounting rabbit hole to go into here, some sort of checkpoint to know X amount of WETH has been gained since last reporting.
[ ] wrap/unwrap Rocket pool
[ ] wrap/unwrap Lido
[ ] wrap/unwrap/stake Frax

Safe Global integration:
[ ] so for simplicity managers roles are EOAs but in real life we probably use safe global instead. So we should look into how to integrate safe into the test files and make sure everything works as intended
